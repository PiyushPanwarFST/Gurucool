This is a full-stack authentication app built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. It provides user authentication functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Redis for session management. MongoDB with Mongoose is used as the database to store user information.

## Features

- User registration: Users can sign up with a unique username and password.
- User authentication: Registered users can log in securely with their credentials.
- Token-based authentication: JSON Web Tokens are used to authenticate users on subsequent requests after login.
- Session management: Redis is used to manage user sessions securely.
- Password hashing: User passwords are hashed before storing them in the database for security.
- CORS support: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled to allow secure communication between the frontend and backend.
